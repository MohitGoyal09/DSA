## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are ordered collections of elements, and they are the simplest data structure. This section covers basic operations and common algorithms related to arrays.

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are data structures made up of nodes, each containing a data element and a reference to the next node. Learn about singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

### Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Discover how to implement and use stacks.

### Queues

Queues are another linear data structure, but they follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Explore different types of queues and their applications.

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Learn about binary trees, binary search trees, and other tree-based structures.

### Graphs

Graphs are versatile data structures used to model relationships between entities. Explore different types of graphs and common graph algorithms.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables are data structures that provide efficient data retrieval using key-value pairs. Understand how to implement and use hash tables.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order. Learn about popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

### Searching

Searching algorithms help locate specific elements within a data structure. Explore linear search, binary search, and more.

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms solve problems related to graphs, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. Discover dynamic programming algorithms and their applications.

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Learn about the greedy algorithm paradigm and its applications.
